# Incrementa

## Overview

Incrementa is a JavaScript/TypeScript library that streamlines the development of incremental and idle games. It offers a modular set of abstract entities and utilities for core mechanics like resource collection, buildings, upgrades, and progressionâ€”without imposing any specific visual style or opinionated structure.

Designed with clarity and developer experience in mind from day one, Incrementa features clean, well-documented code with meaningful naming and inline comments. Every class, method, and config object is easy to understand, making the source code feel like a built-in tutorial. Whether you're building a prototype or diving deep into custom mechanics, Incrementa enables rapid development with minimal friction and no reliance on external documentation.

## Core Concepts

### Resources

Resources are the backbone of any incremental game. These entities are what players collect, spend, and progress with. The library offers a way to define, unlock, and upgrade resources easily.

### Buildings

Buildings automate or enhance resource collection. Buildings can be constructed, upgraded, and used to gather or convert resources.

- Miner: A specialized building that collects resources automatically over time.
- Factory: A building that takes one or more input resources and produces other resources.
- Storage: A building that stores multiple resources with upgradeable capacity. It limits how many resources can be gathered or stored by the player at any given time.

### Upgrades

Upgrades are applied to various entities to enhance their efficiency, reduce cost, increase production rates, or unlock new functionalities. They are applicable to buildings, storage, and resources.

### Timers

Timers track time-based activities like resource gathering, building construction, or research. These are essential for any game mechanic that involves waiting or time-based progression.

### Unlock Conditions

A flexible system for managing when an entity (resource, building, upgrade) becomes available to the player, based on certain conditions.

### Advanced Logging System

Incrementa features a sophisticated, configurable logging system with multiple output drivers and debug mode control. The logging system is completely environment-agnostic, working seamlessly in browsers, Node.js, and any JavaScript runtime.

**Key Features:**
- **Multiple Output Drivers**: Web console (default), file logging, and Node.js-specific console
- **Debug Mode Control**: Global on/off switch for all framework logging
- **Log Levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR with filtering capabilities
- **Runtime Configuration**: Change logging behavior dynamically without restarting
- **Environment Agnostic**: Works in any JavaScript environment using dependency injection
- **Performance Optimized**: Buffered file logging and level-based filtering

## Technical Overview

Incrementa is structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Entities share common traits, reducing redundant code and providing a highly extendable base for additional features.

### Base Object Structure

All entities derive from a common class OBJECT. This class encapsulates shared traits such as:

- ```name```: The name of the entity.
- ```slug```: An internal ID, a "slugged" version of the name.
- ```description```: A short description for the player.
- ```isUnlocked```: Boolean indicating whether the entity is unlocked.
- ```unlockCondition```: Function that determines when the entity can be unlocked.

```ts
class OBJECT {
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  description: string;
  isUnlocked: boolean;
  unlockCondition: any;

  constructor(name: string, description: string, unlockCondition: any) {
    this.name = name;
    this.slug = name.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '-');
    this.description = description;
    this.isUnlocked = false;
    this.unlockCondition = unlockCondition;
    this.onCreated();
  }

  onCreated() { /* logic when created */
  }

  checkUnlockCondition() { /* logic to unlock */
  }

  unlock() {
    this.isUnlocked = true;
    this.onUnlocked();
  }

  onUnlocked() { /* logic when unlocked */
  }
}
```

## Buildings

Building extends OBJECT and introduces additional traits like cost, build time, production rates, and upgrades.

### Miner: Gathers resources.

Factory: Produces resources using other resources as inputs.
Storage: Inherits from Building, manages multiple resources with a capacity.

```ts
class Building extends OBJECT {
  cost: Record<string, number>;
  buildTime: number;
  productionRate: number;
  upgrades: Upgrade[];

  constructor(name: string, description: string, cost: Record<string, number>, buildTime: number, productionRate: number, unlockCondition: any) {
    super(name, description, unlockCondition);
    this.cost = cost;
    this.buildTime = buildTime;
    this.productionRate = productionRate;
    this.upgrades = [];
  }

  addUpgrade(upgrade: Upgrade) {
    this.upgrades.push(upgrade);
  }
}
```

### Resources

Resources are another extension of the OBJECT class. They store an amount and can be gathered or spent.

```ts
class Resource extends OBJECT {
  amount: number;
  rate: number;

  constructor(name: string, description: string, initialAmount: number, rate: number, unlockCondition: any) {
    super(name, description, unlockCondition);
    this.amount = initialAmount;
    this.rate = rate;
  }

  collect(amount: number) {
    this.amount += amount;
  }
}
```

### Upgrades

Upgrades modify the behavior of buildings, resources, and storage. They have an associated cost and effect.

```ts
class Upgrade extends OBJECT {
  effect: any;
  cost: Record<string, number>;

  constructor(name: string, description: string, effect: any, cost: Record<string, number>, unlockCondition: any) {
    super(name, description, unlockCondition);
    this.effect = effect;
    this.cost = cost;
  }

  apply() {
    this.effect();
  }
}
```

### Game State

A Game class manages the current state, holding all resources, buildings, storage, and upgrades.

```ts
class Game {
    resources: Resource[];
    buildings: Building[];
    upgrades: Upgrade[];
    storages: Storage[];

    constructor() {
        this.resources = [];
        this.buildings = [];
        this.upgrades = [];
        this.storages = [];
    }

    saveState() { /* logic to save game state */
    }

    loadState() { /* logic to load game state */
    }
}
```

## Examples

### Creating a Miner Building

```ts
const iron = new Resource("Iron", "A basic metal used for construction", 0, 1, () => true);
const miner = new Miner("Iron Miner", "Mines iron over time", {wood: 10}, 10, 1, 5, iron, () => true);

miner.gatherResources();
```

### Adding an Upgrade

```ts
const upgrade = new Upgrade("Double Mining Speed", "Doubles the rate of mining", () => miner.gatherRate *= 2, {iron: 50}, () => miner.isUnlocked);
miner.addUpgrade(upgrade);
```

### Storage Management

```ts
const storage = new Storage("Iron Storage", "Stores iron", {wood: 20}, 5, 100, () => true);
storage.addResource(iron);
```

## Advanced Logging Configuration

Incrementa includes a basic logging system that can be configured for different environments and use cases.

### Basic Usage

```ts
import { setDebugMode, logger } from 'incrementa';

// Enable debug mode to see framework logs
setDebugMode(true);

// Use the logger in your game code
logger.info('Game started successfully');
logger.warn('Resource limit approaching');
logger.error('Failed to save game state');
logger.debug('Detailed debugging information');
```

### Web Console Logging (Default)

The framework uses web console logging by default, which works in both browsers and Node.js:

```ts
import { Game, SaveManager } from 'incrementa';

// Default configuration - logs to console when debug mode is enabled
const saveManager = new SaveManager(/* your storage provider */);
const game = new Game(saveManager);

// Enable debug mode to see framework logs
setDebugMode(true);
```

### File Logging for Node.js

Configure file logging for server environments or when you need persistent logs:

```ts
import { setLoggerDriver, setDebugMode } from 'incrementa';
import fs from 'fs';

// Configure file logging
setLoggerDriver('file', {
  filePath: './game.log',
  fileWriter: (path, data) => {
    fs.appendFileSync(path, data);
  }
});

setDebugMode(true);

// All framework logs will now be written to ./game.log
```

### Node.js Console with Colors

For Node.js environments, use the enhanced console driver with color coding:

```ts
import { setLoggerDriver, setDebugMode } from 'incrementa';

// Configure Node.js console with colors
setLoggerDriver('node');
setDebugMode(true);

// Logs will appear with color coding in the terminal
```

### Advanced Configuration

```ts
import { 
  setDebugMode, 
  setLogLevel, 
  setLoggerDriver, 
  LogLevel, 
  logger 
} from 'incrementa';

// Enable debug mode
setDebugMode(true);

// Set minimum log level (only WARN and ERROR will be shown)
setLogLevel(LogLevel.WARN);

// Configure async file logging
setLoggerDriver('file', {
  filePath: './logs/incrementa.log',
  fileWriter: async (path, data) => {
    await fs.promises.appendFile(path, data);
  }
});

// Runtime logging configuration
logger.info('This will not be shown (below WARN level)');
logger.warn('This warning will be logged to file');
logger.error('This error will be logged to file');

// Change driver at runtime
setLoggerDriver('web'); // Switch back to console
logger.error('This will now appear in console');
```

### Production Configuration

For production environments, disable debug mode to prevent any logging overhead:

```ts
import { setDebugMode } from 'incrementa';

// Disable all framework logging in production
setDebugMode(false);

// No logs will be output regardless of level or driver configuration
```

### Performance and Debug Mode Behavior

Understanding how the logging system behaves in different modes is crucial for production deployments.

#### Default Behavior (Debug Mode OFF)

```ts
import { logger } from 'incrementa';

// Debug mode is FALSE by default
logger.info('This message will not appear anywhere');
logger.error('This error will also be silent');
logger.warn('No warnings will be shown');
logger.debug('No debug output');

// All calls above return immediately with zero output
```

#### Enabling Debug Mode for Troubleshooting

Enable debug mode at runtime to troubleshoot issues without code changes:

```ts
import { setDebugMode, setLogLevel, LogLevel } from 'incrementa';

// Enable debug mode and set detailed logging
setDebugMode(true);
setLogLevel(LogLevel.DEBUG);

// Now all previously silent logs will appear
```
