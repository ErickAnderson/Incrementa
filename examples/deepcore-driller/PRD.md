Here's a **simple PRD (Product Requirements Document)** for a mining/factory-style HTML/JS game built using the **Incrementa** framework. This game will serve as an introductory example for your library‚Äîshowcasing its capabilities without being overwhelming.

## üéÆ Game PRD: *Deepcore Driller*

### ‚úÖ Overview

*Deepcore Driller* is a minimalist incremental mining game where players extract **Ore**, refine it into **Metal**, and build automated systems to scale production. 
The goal is to optimize the mining loop and unlock the final upgrade: the **Deepcore Reactor**.

This example project created to showcase the use of **Incrementa‚Äôs modular system** and demonstrate:

* Timed resource generation (`Miner`)
* Resource transformation (`Factory`)
* Storage limits (`Storage`)
* Upgrades
* Game progression and win conditions

---

### üèÅ Start & End Game Objectives

* **Start**: The player begins with one manual **Miner** generating **Ore**.
* **Progression Loop**: Gather Ore ‚Üí Convert to Metal ‚Üí Build more Miners/Factories ‚Üí Unlock Upgrades.
* **End**: Build the **Deepcore Reactor** (final unlockable building) by meeting resource and upgrade thresholds.

| Feature                      | Framework Use                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Timed resource gathering     | `Timer`, `Miner`, `Resource`      |
| Resource transformation      | `Factory`, `Timer`                |
| Storage limits               | `Storage`                         |
| Worker assignment (optional) | `Worker` entity                   |
| Upgrade system               | `Upgrade`, `Config`, `BaseEntity` |
| Win condition & UI trigger   | `Milestone` (new entity or event) |

---

### ü™® Resources (3 Total)

1. **Ore** ‚Äì Basic raw material generated by Miners.
2. **Metal** ‚Äì Refined Ore used to build advanced structures.
3. **Energy** ‚Äì Late-game resource used for Deepcore Reactor; created from Metal in the Factory.

### üèóÔ∏è Buildings (4 Total)

| Building                       | Type       | Purpose                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Miner**                      | `Miner`    | Generates Ore over time.                                        |
| **Smelter**                    | `Factory`  | Converts Ore ‚Üí Metal.                                           |
| **Power Core**                 | `Factory`  | Converts Metal ‚Üí Energy.                                        |
| **Storage Unit**               | `Storage`  | Expands capacity for all resources.                             |
| *(Bonus)* **Deepcore Reactor** | `Building` | Win condition; requires large amount of all resources to build. |

---

### üîº Upgrades (3 Total)

1. **Drill Efficiency** ‚Äì +Ore per tick.
2. **Smelting Speed** ‚Äì Faster Metal production.
3. **Storage Optimization** ‚Äì Increases capacity for all resources.

Each upgrade uses `Upgrade` entity with condition-based unlocks (e.g., build 3 Miners to unlock Drill Efficiency).

---

### üß± Game Flow Implementation Plan

1. **Initialize Core Game Loop**

   * Use `game.ts` to boot core entities.
   * Set base resource values and initial entities.

2. **Define Resources**

   * Declare 3 `Resource` instances with capacity values from `Storage`.

3. **Set Up Miners & Factories**

   * Use `Miner` to produce Ore every X seconds.
   * Use `Factory` with input/output config to transform resources on timer.

4. **Add Storage Mechanics**

   * Tie production limits to `Storage` entity.
   * Pause Timers if capacity is full.

5. **Design Upgrades**

   * Add `Upgrade` objects triggered by reaching certain thresholds.
   * Link upgrades to multipliers in relevant entities.

6. **Implement Game Progression**

   * Add event or `Milestone` for final building unlock.
   * Check game state regularly to see if win condition is met (all upgrades + Deepcore Reactor built).

7. **Basic UI Wiring**

   * Simple HTML buttons for:

     * Click to mine by hand clicker style button
     * Building Miners, Smelters, etc.
     * Viewing and triggering upgrades
   * Display resource counts, timers, and building counts.
   * Display progress of buildings being built as well as their current capacity/maximum capacity.

### üìù Deliverables

* `example/deepcore/index.html`
* Minimal CSS for clarity via TailwindCSS
* JS file using Incrementa exports to define the game loop
* README walkthrough of how entities are created and linked teaching developer how to use the framework
